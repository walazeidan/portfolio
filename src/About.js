                <p className="bio-border">My background is in medicine. I studied for 5 years and earned my bachelors degree in 2019. Shortly before graduating I started taking an interest in my brothers work as a front end developer. I was fascinated by all the algorithms and the functions. I couldnâ€™t believe that all these seemingly unrelated words and numbers were the foundations upon which every website was built on. After graduating, I decided to take a break before jumping into a full time career as a junior doctor. I used this time to follow my curiosity into coding, doing short courses on various websites such as Codecademy and Freecodecamp - before I knew it, I was hooked! Finally in August of 2021, I took the final plunge and began a 3 month Software Engineering course with General Assembly. It is here that I believe I really honed my skills as a developer. I used the skills I learned on the course to develop 4 applications which you can learn more about below.</p>
